### Event-Driven Congestion Digital Twin & Predictive Operations Platform

TRAFIQ360 is an AI-powered traffic operations platform built for the Bengaluru Traffic Police that predicts the congestion impact of planned and unplanned events, optimally deploys officers using Integer Linear Programming, and simulates real-time road network diversions — all from a single browser dashboard. Unlike passive dashboards, TRAFIQ360 closes the loop: it learns from post-event officer feedback and automatically retrains its ML models to improve future predictions.

## Machine Learning Models

| Model | Task | Algorithm | Key Metric | Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Impact Score | Regression (1–10) | XGBoost | RMSE | ~0.42 |
| Duration | Regression (minutes) | XGBoost (log scale) | RMSE | ~18 min |
| Road Closure | Binary Classification | LightGBM | AUC-ROC | ~0.83 |

**Features used:** `event_cause`, `corridor`, `zone`, `junction`, `hour`, `day_of_week`, `event_type`, `priority`, `historical_severity`

**SHAP explainability** is computed for every prediction, returning the top 3 feature contributions with direction (up/down) to the impact score.

---

## Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/akshitag001/TRAFIQ360.git`
2. `cd TRAFIQ360`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python server.py`
5. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

> **Note:** The OSM graph file (`data/bengaluru_graph.graphml`, ~24 MB) is included in the repo. First startup takes ~15–20 seconds to load the graph and ML models.

## Judge Demo — 6 Step Walkthrough

1. **Forecast tab** → Fill in: Event Cause = `IPL Match (public_event)`, Corridor = `CBD 2`, Hour = `19`, Priority = `High` → Click **"Analyze Impact"** → See impact score, closure probability, SHAP drivers rendered.

2. **Wait 2 seconds** → The prediction result panel shows score in red (≥7) with 3 SHAP feature explanations below.

3. **GIS Digital Twin tab** → Map auto-loads with Bengaluru road network. Click **"Simulate Diversion"** with Origin = `MekhriCircle`, Destination = `SilkBoardJunc` → 3 ranked alternate routes drawn on map with load percentages.

4. **Resources tab** → Adjust officer slider to 30 → Click **"Run ILP Optimization"** → Junction deployment table appears with optimal officer/barricade allocation per junction.

5. **Forecast tab** → Click **"Generate Operational Playbook (PDF)"** → 5-page PDF auto-downloads with cover page, SHAP table, ILP deployment table, diversion routes.

6. **Learning tab** → Click **"Trigger Retraining"** → Progress bar updates every 2 seconds → On completion, new model version appears in the Model Registry chart.

> **Keyboard shortcut:** `Ctrl+D` triggers the judge demo sequence automatically.

## Known Limitations

The OSM road network is pre-cached (`bengaluru_graph.graphml`) and reflects the road topology at download time — live traffic incidents are not fetched from a real-time source. The CCTV intelligence pipeline uses simulated image inputs with Gemini Vision analysis; a real deployment would require authenticated CCTV feed APIs. Model retraining must be manually triggered from the Learning tab — there is no automated scheduler for production deployment. The ILP solver uses a 3-second time limit to guarantee UI responsiveness; very large officer pools with many junctions may return a proportional fallback rather than the true optimal. SHAP values are computed on the fly and may be slow (~200ms) for the first prediction after server start.
